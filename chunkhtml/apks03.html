                <p>It all boils down to one critical issue: </p>
                <p>With the current SVG 1.1 (and draft 1.2) standard there is no way to
                    statically find out the bounding box of an arbitrary text string for later usage
                    in the SVG script. </p>
                <p>This very surprising omission in the SVG standard makes it in principal
                    impossible to even do such a simple thing as drawing a frame around a text
                    programatically since there is no easy way to find out the size, in the given
                    coordinate system, of the string. </p>
                <p>Since the actual bounding box is dependent on both font, style, size, etc as
                    well as the actual SVG viewer text-layout engine implementation this calculation
                    cannot be done outside the viewer. It must be part of the SVG standard elements. </p>
                <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
                    <p> Now, anyone who are familiar with SVG would jump in here and point out
                        that this is not entirely correct. For the specific case of a frame around a
                        text it would be possible to use a filter function as specified by the
                        standard but that is a special case that just could be used to draw an
                        effect that looks like a frame around a text (using the objectBoundingBox
                        property). It is still not possible to find out the bounding box. </p>
                    <p>The second approach would be to to add some DOM Javascript code in the SVG
                        script which upon execution of the script could in theory find out the
                        bounding box and adjust suitable attributes in the script. </p>
                </div>

                <p>There are many places in the library where it is absolutely essential to find
                    out the bounding box of a text string to adjust the position of other object in
                    the graph. For example margins for titles, column width in gantt charts and
                    legends and so on. Without this functionality it will be impossible to add SVG
                    output without significantly reducing the functionality and in essence create a
                    new version of the library suitable for this reduced functionality that is
                    brought upon us by the use of SVG. </p>

                <p>Looking at this from a more positive view instead of explaining why it cannot
                    be done there are in principal only two workarounds (neither which is a 100%
                    solution) </p>

                        <p>Using a single fixed font. Restricting the library to one specific
                            fixed font would make it possible to calculate the bounding box for the
                            string. Due to differences in the existing viewers it would be necessary
                            to have some safety margins built in when doing this calculation.
                            However this would significantly impact the visual appearance of the
                            graphs. </p>

                        <p>Using heuristics By establishing some "good enough" heuristics for a
                            plain font we can try to find a guesstimate of the size of the string.
                            Unfortunately it is a big difference in length between "iiiii" and
                            "wwwww" even though they have the same number of characters. So without
                            fully implementing the same algorithm as some SVG viewer text-layout
                            engine uses this method cannot guarantee that the text will always fit
                            without making the box fit the worst case. In addition this method will
                            have some difficulty in handling rotated text strings. </p>

                <p>What would be required in the standard to solve this is a new basis element
                    which could be used to record the bounding box of a particular text string for
                    later reference. To just give some idea on what is needed some "pseudo-SVG" that
                    we would need is something along the lines of: </p>
                <div class="hl-main"><table class="hl-table" width="100%"><tr><td class="hl-gutter" align="right" valign="top"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</pre></td><td class="hl-main" valign="top"><pre><span class="hl-code">&lt;def&gt;
  &lt;boundingbox id=&quot;bb1&quot; 
               text=&quot;This is a text&quot; style=&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/def&gt;
&lt;rect x=&quot;50+#bb1.x1-10&quot; y=&quot;50+#bb1.y1-10&quot; 
      width=&quot;#bb1.width+20&quot; 
      height=&quot;#bb1.height+20&quot; /&gt;
&lt;text x=&quot;50&quot; y=&quot;50&quot; &gt;
  &lt;tref xlink:href=&quot;#bb1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/text&gt;</span></pre></td></tr></table></div>
                <p>The basic idea is that in the def-section all text strings to later be used in
                    the script is defined together with the font (and any other formatting
                    applicable). These text strings are defined in the new SVG element "boundingbox"
                    which will calculate the bounding box of the given text. These text string is
                    later referenced in the actual text with a standard tref element. The bounding
                    box attributes can then be used in the positioning of the text with a "#"
                    reference based on the id of the new introduced element "boundingbox" The above
                    script would then draw a text string positioned at (50,50) with a frame around
                    it with a 10 units margin all around.</p>

                <p>Since we make no claim to be experts in all aspects of the SVG standard (which
                    is fairly big) it might be possible that there is some way to still solve this
                    that has eluded us so we would be very interested in getting a second opinion of
                    these findings. We are aware of the SVG method GetBBox() but this would not work
                    in the library very well. The reason is that this is not a static function but
                    requires the context of a DOM script. This would require a substantially rewrite
                    of the library since there are graphs where every single coordinate would have
                    to be back-patched in the end (possible in multiple passes - since the
                    calculation of one bounding box would be needed to adjust another element). </p>
                <p>This means that the script would no longer be static but would require the
                    library to generate "self-modifying" DOM script at the end. The logic of the
                    library assumes that the bounding box of text can be found out at the place of
                    creation and then this bounding box can be used to adjust subsequent
                    coordinates. </p>
                <p>So to summarize this we do not feel that the potential back patching of every
                    single element in the SVG image at the end in a DOM script is a solution.

                <p>Since we still find it very hard to believe this giant oversight in the
                    standard we would be happy to receive comments on these conclusions. </p>
