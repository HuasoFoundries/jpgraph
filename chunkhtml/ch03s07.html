            <p>Unfortunately there are many parameters in a server installation that may affect
                the execution of PHP so the steps below can only give some indications of how to
                further investigate some potential problems.</p>
            <p>Experience shows that most of the trouble are caused by either an old buggy
                version of the free-type TTF library or using an old antiquated version of the GD
                library. So before starting trouble shooting the scripts please make sure that you
                have an up to date PHP installation with the bundled version of the GD library (as
                describe in the previous sections) and a working FreeType library installed.</p>
            <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
                        <p><span class="bold"><strong>No image is displayed.</strong></span></p>
                        <p>The first thing you should do is to isolate the problem by calling
                            your graph script directly in the browser. There are then two variants
                            of this problem. </p>
                        <p>
                            </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a"><li class="listitem">
                                    <p>No data is sent back from the server.</p>
                                    <p>You can verify this by calling your graph script directly
                                        in the browser and then check the source (click "view
                                        source" menu item in the browser). If this is a truly blank
                                        image then no data was sent back from the browser.</p>
                                    <p>This means that the PHP process has been terminated
                                        prematurely before it could send any data back. This could
                                        be caused by either the PHP process crashing (due to a bug
                                        in either PHP or your HTTP server) or the HTTP server
                                        crashed. This is often due to a broken PHP installation and
                                        more than often a problem with the True Type libraries. </p>
                                    <p>It could also be caused by the PHP script running longer
                                        than the maximum allowed execution time (as specified in
                                            <code class="filename">php.ini</code>). The first thing you
                                        should do is to increase the maximum allowed execution time.
                                        If this does not solve the problem you should look in the
                                        log files for both your HTTP server and PHP to try to find
                                        clues to if the PHP process really crashed. Another
                                        possibility is that the PHP process uses more than the
                                        maximum allowed memory (as set in
                                            <code class="filename">php.ini</code>) and then it is terminated.
                                        So a good first step is to put some really high values for
                                        memory and time just to take away these parameters.</p>

                                    <p>The data sent back is corrupt.</p>
                                    <p>Depending on your browser this can show up differently but
                                        a common symptom is a "red X" in the browser. In order to
                                        debug this you should make sure that you have followed the
                                        steps in <a class="xref" href="ch03s03.html#sec2.config-dev-server" title="Configuring JpGraph/PHP on a development server">Configuring JpGraph/PHP on a development server</a> to make sure you
                                        have output buffering disabled and have maximum error
                                        checking enabled in PHP. The most common cases for this type
                                        of problem is having enabled output buffering and some minor
                                        errors in the script which causes PHP to emit warnings which
                                        gets included in the image data. </p>
                                    <p>A very common mistake is to have some white spaces in the
                                        script before the opening "<code class="code">&lt;?php</code>". This
                                        white space will be added to the output buffer and then get
                                        mixed up with the image data causing the image data to be
                                        corrupt. A similar problem can occur if multiple newlines
                                        are added after the final <code class="code">"?&gt;"</code>
                                    </p>

                        <p><span class="bold"><strong>An error message saying "Fonts are not available or not
                                readable" </strong></span></p>
                        <p>When an image contains TTF fonts you might get an error message saying
                            that the fonts are not available or not readable. If this is the case it
                            is first necessary to check that the font files really exist in the
                            directory that is specified in <code class="filename">jpg-config.inc.php</code>
                            and that they are also readable by the HTTP/PHP process. If this is the
                            case then it is necessary to check that the names of the font files are
                            the one that JpGraph assumes, see <a class="xref" href="ch03s02.html#sec3.name-of-ttf-files" title="Name of TTF font files">Name of TTF font files</a>. Another problem can be if
                            the PHP installation is running in "safe mode" (See <code class="uri"><a class="uri" href="http://se.php.net/manual/en/ini.sect.safe-mode.php" target="_top">PHP
                                Manual: Security and safe mode</a></code>) and has enabled strict
                            directory policy via an "<code class="code">open_basedir</code>" restriction. This
                            will prevent the PHP process from reading any files outside the
                            specified base directory. If this is enabled there is no way around for
                            PHP to read any files outside this restriction and any TTF files
                            necessary must be moved so that they can be accessed within the realms
                            of the specified basedirectory.</p>
                        <p>If you are running IIS and Win2k and get the error "Can't find font"
                            when trying to use TTF fonts then try to change the paths to UNIX style,
                            i.e. "<code class="filename">/usr/local/fonts/ttf/</code>". Remember that the
                            path is absolute and not relative to the <code class="filename">htdocs</code>
                            catalogue.</p>
                        <p>If you are running on Unix server please keep in mind that file names
                            are case sensitive.</p>

                        <p>A common mistake is to have a space in the beginning of the image
                            script which the HTTP server will send back to the browser. The browser
                            now assumes that the data coming back from this script is text since it
                            hasn't received an explicit header. When then the image headers get sent
                            back to the browser to forewarn the browser of the forthcoming image
                            data the browser will not like that as it has already assumed the data
                            stream was a text stream. The browser will then give the infamous
                            "Headers already sent error".</p>
                        <p>Make sure that your script has no white space before the opening
                                "<code class="code">&lt;?php</code>" statement or a number of blank lines after

                            of the FreeType library. Another symptom of a an (old) buggy FreeType
                            library is that the fonts are not correctly rotated (the text string is
