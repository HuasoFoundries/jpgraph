            <p>This manual covers versions up to v3.1 of JpGraph. There are three main branches
                of the library: </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">The "1.x.y" branch</span></dt><dd>
                            <p>The 1.x.y series is only intended for PHP4 and is not compatible
                                with PHP5 running in strict mode. If you are running an older
                                installation with only PHP4 you must use this branch of the library.
                                In addition you must use this branch if for some obscure reason only
                                the very old GD 1.x library is available in the installation (teh GD
                                library is the low level graphic primitives library used by JpGraph
                                and available in PHP).</p>
                            <div class="caution" title="Caution" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Caution</h3>
                                <p>The 1.x.y series is since 31 Dec 2008 no longer maintained and
                                    should be considered deprecated. There will be no more
                                    maintenance releases made on this branch.</p>
                            </div>
                        </dd><dt><span class="term">The "3.x.y" branch</span></dt><dd>
                            <p>The "3.x.y" series is the current one and is only intended to run
                                on PHP5. This code is optimized for use both with PHP5 as well as
                                the new (and bundled version) of the GD 2.x library. Hence this will
                                not work if you only have the older GD 1.x graphic primitive library
                                installed. However, all modern PHP installations since 2006 have
                                shipped with GD 2.x so this should not in reality be any
                                problem.</p>

                                <p>Please note that it is not possible to run the "3.x.y" series
                                    on PHP4. If you need to run on PHP4 then you <span class="bold"><strong>must</strong></span> use the 1.x version of the
                                    library.</p>

                        </dd><dt><span class="term">The "3.x.y-p" branch (The pro-version)</span></dt><dd>
                            <p>This is in principle the same as the "3.x.y" branch with the
                                difference that the pro-version includes a number of additional
                                modules (see <a class="xref" href="pt05.html" title="Part V. Additional graph types available in the professional version">Part V. Additional graph types available in the professional version</a>) not available in the free
                                version. This includes both some additional graph types as well as
                                1D and 2D barcodes. In addition the professional license gives three
                                months of email support for installing and configuring the
                                library.</p>
