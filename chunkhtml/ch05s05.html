            <p>The two common steps for creating and using a Graph on your Web-page are</p>
            <p>

                        <p>Create a script that constructs the graph, by getting the data and
                            specifying how the graph should look, the size, what colors to use, what
                            fonts to use and specifying other augmentations on the graph.</p>

                        <p>On the HTML page where the graph(s) should be displayed include add
                            one or more <span class="markup">&lt;img&gt;</span> tags which links to the PHP graphs
                            script. Of course it is perfectly possible to call the image script
                            directly in the browser to just display the generated image in the
                            browser. This way it is possible to include any number of graphs on the
                            Web-page.</p>
                    </li></ol></div><p>

            <div class="tip" title="Tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                <p>One further thing to keep in mind is that it is also possible to pass
                    arguments to the image script via the normal HTTP GET/POST arguments. </p>
                <p>For example </p>
                <p>
                    </p><pre class="screen">&lt;img src="showgraph.php?a=1&amp;b=2"&gt; </pre><p>
                </p>
                <p>This could be used to control the appearance of the image or perhaps send data
                    to the image which will be displayed. Note that this is probably not the best
                    way to send large amount of data to plot. Instead the only practical way, for
                    large data sizes, is to get all the data in the image script directly, perhaps
                    from a DB. Another alternative for large amount of data to be sent to the image
                    script is by creating a POST request to the image script. This is further
                    discussed in ?? (Getting hold of the data to be displayed)</p>

                <p>JpGraph is completely Object oriented so all calls will be action on specific
                    instances of classes. One of the fundamental classes is the <code class="code">Graph()</code>
                    class which represents the entire graph.</p>
                <p>After the creation of the <code class="code">Graph()</code> object all the code lines to
                    construct the details of the graph are added. The final method called in an
                    image script will most likely be the <code class="code">Graph::Stroke()</code> method. This
                    will send the constructed image back to the browser. A variation of this is used
                    if the graph are supposed to have image maps (CSIM). In that case the final
                    method will be <code class="code">Graph::StrokeCSIM()</code></p>

                                burden of the PHP server, works by avoiding running all the code
                                that follows the initial <code class="code">Graph()</code> call by checking if
                                the image has already been created and in that case directly send

                                browser. The filename used for the image can be either manually
                                selected or automatically created based on the script name. In
                                addition it is also possible to specify a timeout value in the
                                initial call to the Graph() constructor to indicate how long the

                    graphic format is chosen:</p>

                    method the library actually starts to build the image. Assuming there are no
                    errors detected when the image is generated the library will now take the

                    <p>This is an error that everyone, and we really mean everyone, will see one
                        time or the other when producing dynamic images with PHP.</p>
                    <p>First, this is not a problem with JpGraph per se. What has happened is
                        that your PHP script which produces the image has already returned some data
                        to the client before the image header has been sent. </p>
                    <p>This is most often caused by one or more spaces before the first
                            "<code class="code">&lt;?php</code>" statement. What happens is that the server
                        normally sends back all data it finds in the files it reads. Since the
                        server no sees a space, a perfectly valid character, it will send that data
                        back to the client. However, before it does that it will automatically
                        generate a header. Since it has seen a normal character data it will
                        generate a header telling the client to expect a data stream of
                        characters.</p>
                    <p>When later JpGraph tries to send its image header the server will detect
                        that a header has already been sent and since each HTTP data stream can only
                        have one type (and hence only one header) it will generate an error message
                        which is sent back to the client.</p>
                    <p>To correct this error check your files for any output (even a single
                        space) before the call to <code class="code">Graph::Graph()</code> (or
                            <code class="code">Graph::Stroke()</code>) If you are running on older version of a
                        Windows server this problem could also be caused by blank line at the end of
                        the files. On some older Windows versions together with PHP4 it might also
                        be called by a file ending in a newline (which all the JpGraph library files
                        does) Remove the newline so that the file ends just after the final
                            "<code class="code">?&gt;</code>" Also remember that when you include external file
                        using <code class="code">include/include_once</code> and so on PHP includes the whole
                        content of the file; this content of the file also includes any potential
                        carriage return/line feed or "blank" space before "<code class="code">&lt;?php</code>"
                        and after "<code class="code">?&gt;"</code> These "dirty characters" will cause the problem
                        just described. </p>

                <p>In addition to just streaming the file back to the browser it is also possible
                    to write the file directly to a named file. The file name is given as an
                    argument to the Graph::Stroke() method. For example as </p>
                <p><code class="code">$graph-&gt;Stroke('/tmp/myimage.png');</code></p>
                <p>There are three important things to note here</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
                            <p>The PHP process must have write permission on the directory you

                                through your browser this means that the HTTP server process must
                                have write permission on that directory.</p>

                    <p>In this case you should instead use the method
                            <code class="code">Graph::StrokeStore($aFileName)</code> which was introduced in
                        version 2.5 of the library. If you are on a previous version and for various
                        reasons cannot upgrade then you can use the following "trick" to achieve
                        this.</p>
                    <p>The idea is to use the <code class="code">_IMG_HANDLER</code> option that forces the
                            <code class="code">Graph::Stroke()</code> to just return the image handler and then
                        stop. We can then manually first send the image to the chosen file and then
                        stream it back to the browser using some internal methods in the library.
                        The following code snippet shows how this is done.

                                    include an image in a PDF generated with the "fpdf"

                <p>Some browser may not send back a request to the HTTP server unless the user
                    presses "Refresh" (F5 - in most browsers). This can lead to problems that the
                    user is seeing old data since the file stamp of the script might not change but
                    the data the script is using to create the image/graph is. A simple trick is to
                    add a dummy time argument which is not used in the script. </p>
                <p>For example </p>
                <p><code class="code">&lt;img src="myimagescript.php?dummy=\'.now()."&gt;</code>
                </p>
                <p>Since the dummy argument will be a new number whenever the browser checks it
                    the browser understands that it must re-fetch the script and force the image to
                    be reloaded and redisplayed.</p>
                <p>It is also important to be aware of any internal caching the browser might do.
                    The general problem with dynamically generated images is that the image
                    generating script (file) remains the same. This makes the browser believe that
                    the data hasn\'t changed (since the script is the same) and if the browser
                    already has issued a previous GET request and has the data cached it will not
                    send a new GET if the time stamp on the file is the same since it then believes
                    it should and can use the old browser cached version.</p>

                <p>Some browsers, most notable IE (&lt; v7) can have issues printing a dynamic
                    image. This is because the designers of IE assumed that all images are
                    traditional images that are available as static image files. Not that they could
                    be dynamically generated. This unfortunately have some implications.</p>

                            <p>IE will often (always?) re-fetch the page when preparing to print.
                                This means that a new image will be generated and is perhaps very
                                different from what the user thinks he is printing (if the data is
                                changing rapidly).</p>
                        </li><li class="listitem">
                            <p>Some older versions of IE simply refuses to print dynamic images
                                if they are not available as a static "*.png", "*.jpg" etc. file.
                                The only known workaround is to make sure to use static
                                images.</p>
                        </li></ol></div><p>
                </p>
                <p>There is one final reported problem to be aware of. Normally most browsers
                    will support "right-clicking" on an image to download the image locally.
                    However, some older versions of IE will become very confused when dynamic images
                    are used. This could manifest itself as that the file type is not the wanted,
                    for example, trying to download a "*.png" image could cause the file to be saved
                    as a "*.bmp" file instead. </p>
                <p>Newer versions of IE seems to be able to handle dynamic images much
                    better.</p>
                <p>It should also be mentioned that some older versions of FireFox (&lt; v3)
                    could in some circumstances fetch a dynamic image twice causing unnecessary load
                    on the server (See <code class="uri"><a class="uri" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=331126" target="_top">FireFox
                        Bugzilla</a></code>). However, there are no known issues with dynamic images in
                    current versions of FireFox and IE (i.e. IE v8).</p>
