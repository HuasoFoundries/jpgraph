            <p>When you have verified the necessary preconditions as described in the previous
                paragraphs it is time to install the library. The "installing" part is nothing more
                than copying the files in the distribution to a place in the directory structure
                where you script can find the library files. On a Unix system it is common to
                install PHP libraries under "<code class="filename">/usr/share/php/</code>". On a windows
                system there is really no standard path for installing PHP libraries so you have to
                decide your self. </p>
            <p>The important thing here is that the path to the library is included in the PHP
                search path, i.e. it is in one of the paths that PHP searches when it tries to
                resolve a "<code class="code">require_once</code>" or "<code class="code">include</code>" statements.
                Furthermore, the included examples and demo applications (included in the pro
                version) assumes that the library is installed under the directory
                    "<code class="filename">jpgraph/</code>".</p>
            <p>As an example the following commands will install a specific version of the
                library on a Unix server. If we assume that you have downloaded the library to the
                    "<code class="filename">/tmp/</code>" directory and are already standing in this
                directory the following commands will setup the library to be used</p>
            <p>
                </p><pre class="screen">root:/tmp&gt; tar xzf jpgraph-2.5.tar.gz
root:/tmp&gt; cp -r jpgraph-2.5 /usr/shar/php/
root:/tmp&gt; ln -s /usr/shar/php/jpgraph-2.5 /usr/shar/php/jpgraph</pre><p>
            </p>
            <p>The last line makes a symbolic link from "jpgraph" to the actual version of the
                library. This way you can try out different versions of the library without having
                to make any changes in your scripts. You just point out a different version of the
                library in the symbolic link.</p>

                    <p>In many default configuration the allowed memory for PHP is not enough for
                        complex graph script since they (as many other image manipulation programs)
                        can require a lot of memory. On a development server there should be at
                        least 32MB memory allowed for the HTTP/PHP process. To verify this do the
                        following</p>
                    <p>
                        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
                                <p>Open <code class="filename">php.ini</code> for editing.</p>

                                <p>where "xx" is some number. Now make sure that you have at
                                    least 32MB allowed by making sure the line reads</p>
                                <p><code class="code">memory_limit = 32M</code></p>
                                <p>Note that fore very large images this might not be enough.
                                    Consider the following example.</p>
                                <p>Assume you need to create an 1200x1024 image in true color.
                                    Just the plain image in itself will require 1200x1020x4 bytes,
                                    which is roughly 4.7MB RAM during internal processing the
                                    library can need up to three times that amount of memory so this
                                    means that just for the image the library needs around of ~15MB
                                    of RAM. If we then take the memory needed to load PHP as well as
                                    the entire JpGraph library and dynamically execute and parse the
                                    library it can easily consume another ~15MB RAM. If the image is
                                    very complex and requires a huge number of objects to be created
                                    (a typical example is a large Gantt chart) it might be necessary
                                    to double the allowed memory to 64MB RAM. </p>

                    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Setting maximum allowed run time</strong></span></p>
                    <p>By default many installations have very short maximum run time for the PHP
                        scripts. Common figures are 10s. For normal interactive use involving plain
                        text processing this is usually adequate. However, producing large and
                        complex images might take considerable time (as do all images processing).
                        For this reason the maximum time limit for PHP should be increased to a
                        minimum of 20s (depending on the complexity of your images as well as any
                        associated data processing it might be necessary to allow up to
                        30-40s).</p>
                    <p>The allowed running time is controlled by the <code class="filename">php.ini</code>
                        setting</p>
                    <p><code class="code">max_execution_time = xx</code></p>
                    <p>where "xx" is some number. Recommended setting is therefore </p>
                    <p><code class="code">max_execution_time = 30</code></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Disabling output buffer</strong></span></p>
                    <p>The next part of the <code class="filename">php.ini</code> file that might need
                        changing is the output buffer. In short this should be disabled and we will
                        shortly explain why. To check this do the following</p>
                    <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
                                <p>Open <code class="filename">php.ini</code> for editing</p>
                            </li><li class="listitem">
                                <p>Locate the line saying </p>
                                <p><code class="code">output_buffering = xx</code></p>
                                <p>where "xx" is some number. Make sure that this line is
                                    commented out, i.e. it reads</p>
                                <p><code class="code">; output_buffering = xx</code></p>
                            </li></ol></div><p>This reason we want this to be commented out is that during
                        development we want to be able to see the potential error messages produced
                        by the library and having the output buffering enabled will actually prevent
                        this. Fully understanding why this is the case is good first step into the
                        added complexity of producing images with PHP compared with just outputting
                        text. Understanding this requires us to understand a few basic principles
                        about the HTTP protocol. Especially how MIME encodings of data works.</p>
                    <p>The following explanation is slightly simplified since a full description
                        of the HTTP protocol would bring us a bit to far in this manual</p>
                    <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
                                <p>A client (e.g. browser) requests data from the server by
                                    issuing a GET (or possible a POST) command to the server. This
                                    is what happens when you enter a URI i the address bar in the
                                    browser.</p>
                            </li><li class="listitem">
                                <p>The server replies with a data stream (or an error if the
                                    requested data wasn't available). This data stream is prepended
                                    with header (MIME header) that tells the client (e.g. the
                                    browser) how to interpret the data that follows. The most common
                                    type (and the default type if no header is sent by a faulty
                                    server) is "text/html" . This tells the client to interpret the
                                    data as plain text with embedded HTML encoding. </p>
                                <p>When the data is to be interpreted as an image the header will
                                    instead be one of the image headers, for example
                                        <code class="code">"image/png"</code> or <code class="code">"image/jpeg"</code>. When
                                    the client receives this header it will Interpret all the
                                    following data as an image encoded in the indicated format. </p>
                                <p>The important thing to keep in mind here is that each server
                                    reply can have one and only one MIME type. This is the key to
                                    further understanding the specific issues with dynamic image
                                    generation. This explains why if a PHP script running on the
                                    server sends a header first indicating that the following data
                                    it sends should be interpreted by the client as an image it
                                    cannot send both image data and some text.</p>
                            </li></ol></div><p>We are now in a position to explain how output buffering would
                        make debugging more difficult.</p>
                    <p>Normally all output from a PHP script is sequentially, i.e. the header
                        must first be sent and then the data. If no header is sent or plain text is
                        sent without a header the client will interpret this as
                            <code class="code">"text/html"</code>. One purpose with "output_buffer" it to
                        circumvent this to allow a certain amount of output to be put in a buffer
                        for a while and later when some processing has determined what header should
                        be sent the data is prepended with the correct header and the rest of the
                        data is then sent. </p>
                    <p>What could now happen is the following (not unlikely scenario): </p>

                                    instead they will be put into the output buffer. When later the
                                    scripts starts outputting the proper image header and the image
                                    data it gets added to the output buffer where your previous

                                    fail to decode the data (since it is not proper image data) and

                                    depending on how a certain client handles a corrupt
                                    image.</p>

                        output buffering. In this way the warning will be sent back to the client as
                        soon as they are generated by PHP and will allow you to act on them. </p>

                        considered in a production environment.</p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold"><strong>Setting the memory limits</strong></span>
                    </p>
                    <p>The one thing to keep in mind here is that each active connection will
                        spawn a unique PHP instance (HTTP process). This means that the memory limit
                        set per PHP process can cause a very high memory demand on a busy server
                        with many simultaneous connections. For this reason it is important that
                        during system test (before going into production) the actual needed memory
                        limit is determined. </p>
                    <p>For a busy server it is not uncommon to dimension it so it can handle 100
                        simultaneous connections. If the limit of r each PHP process is set to 32MB
                        this means that the server needs at least ~3.2GB memory just to handle the
                        PHP processes (if they are all using there maximum allowed memory).</p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold"><strong>Setting maximum allowed run time</strong></span>
                    </p>
                    <p>The same principle applies to a the allowed run time. For a production
                        server with high load and many simultaneous users it might be necessary to
                        increase the maximum allowed execution time just to be sure no process is
                        terminated due to it reaching its maximum allowed run time. When that
                        happens the PHP process will be killed an no output sent back to the client
                        (e.g. the browser).</p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold"><strong>Disabling output buffer</strong></span>
                    </p>
                    <p>The output buffer should be disabled on the production server as well
                        since enabling this will slow down the PHP and put a higher demand on the
                        memory requirements.</p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold"><strong>Enabling adequate error checking</strong></span>
                    </p>
                    <p>On a production server it is not a good idea to display all PHP error
                        messages to the end user so the display of error messages should be disabled
                        and the error messages should only be logged to a file.</p>

                        <p> On a production server it is also a good to idea to have the

                    <p>On a production server it is best not to show detailed error messages to
                        an end user. Instead it is better to have a generic error message that
                        indicates a server problem and give an error code which can be decoded by
                        looking it up in the table in <a class="xref" href="aph.html" title="Appendix H. Error messages">Appendix H. <i>Error messages</i></a> Using a generic error message is achieved by

                <p>As was mentioned before the library should be installed somewhere in the PHP
                    include path. There are two ways of configuring the include path:</p>

                    the library files by, for example, writing "<code class="code">include</code>" or
                        "<code class="code">require_once</code>" statements such as </p>

                        <p>More detailed information on the alias directive is also available in

                <p>When accessing examples and test code through a regular bowser during
                    development the scripts must be available in document root (or somewhere beneath
                    that root) the root is traditionally named <code class="code">/htdocs</code>. Having a
                    development code/repository directly under this root directory is not a good
                    idea. For example, write access to a document root (even on a development
                    server) should be restricted, in addition the paths given to a test team should
                    be the same whatever version is currently under test so storing different
                    versions with different names under the root is also a poor setup.</p>
                <p>A much better and easy, approach is to use the powerful concept of alias in
                    Apache. This is a way of mapping a URL to a specific directory on the server.
                    For example if <code class="uri"><a class="uri" href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?projectid=tools.pdt" target="_top">Eclipse-PDT</a></code>
                    is used as an IDE to develop PHP it is mandatory to have a workspace setup where
                    all the working files resides. Assuming that a local developer has his workspace
                    directly in his home directory, say <code class="filename">~joe/workspace</code>, we
                    could configure an alias so that the workspace is accessible by the alias
                        "<code class="filename">http://localhost/ws/</code>" by adding the following
                    configuration in the Apache setup file(s)</p>
                <div class="hl-main"><table class="hl-table" width="100%"><tr><td class="hl-gutter" align="right" valign="top"><pre>1

</pre></td><td class="hl-main" valign="top"><pre><span class="hl-code">Alias /ws /home/joe/worksapce
&lt;Directory /home/joe/workspace&gt;
  Order allow,deny
  Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;</span></pre></td></tr></table></div>
                <p>In this particular setup we use very liberal settings, allowing basically
                    everyone with server access to access the directory. Using this approach makes
                    it very easy to use the same test setup but allow testing of different
                    branches/versions of the code.</p>
                <p>Depending on the system these configurations can reside in different places.
                    However, a very common structure is to keep all these small configuration files
                    under <code class="filename">/etc/apache/conf.d/</code> The main Apache configuration
                    then reads all the files (regardless of there name) that are stored under this
                    directory. </p>
                <p>As a final example we show a further slightly more complex example (which
                    actually shows how most of our developers have there systems setup for PHP5
                    development). This example adds options to do directory listing and allows the
                    server to follow symbolic links. More information on available argument for the
                    directive option is available in the official Apache documentation <code class="uri"><a class="uri" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#options" target="_top">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#options</a></code></p>
