## JPGRAPH 3.6.0

This is an unnoficial refactor of [JpGraph](http://jpgraph.net/) with thefollowing differences:
- the app was fully refactored adding namespaces, proper folder hierarchy, separating each class in its own file and stripping the use of `require` and `include` to the bare minimum
- it provides full composer compatibility
- it has PSR-4 autoloading
- it makes requirement checks so you can't go wrong
- it has release tags, to let `composer install` use your cached packages instead of pulling from github every time
- I stripped the docs because they are useless weight in a dependency. [You can find them here](http://jpgraph.net/doc/)
- The Examples folder were moved upwards, althought they are now in categories. Not all of them work at this point
- Examples pointing to features not present in the free tool were stripped from said folder (e.g. Barcodes)
- If the chosen font isn't found, it falls back to existing fonts instead of crashing
- If you try to use antialiasing functions not present in your current GD installation, it disables them instead of crashing

## How to install

Using composer

```sh
composer require amenadiel/jpgraph:^3.6
```

## How to use

See the [examples folder](https://github.com/amenadiel/jpgraph/tree/master/Examples) for working samples. The general concept is:

   - run `composer install`

   - require `vendor/autoload.php` it the top of your script

   - generate a graph with a snippet like the following

   ```php
   use Amenadiel\JpGraph\Graph;
   use Amenadiel\JpGraph\Plot;

   $data = array(40, 21, 17, 14, 23);
   $p1 = new Plot\PiePlot($data);
   $p1->ShowBorder();
   $p1->SetColor('black');
   $p1->SetSliceColors(array('#1E90FF', '#2E8B57', '#ADFF2F', '#DC143C', '#BA55D3'));

   $graph = new Graph\PieGraph(350, 250);
   $graph->title->Set("A Simple Pie Plot");
   $graph->SetBox(true);

   $graph->Add($p1);
   $graph->Stroke();
   ```

### Wishlist

- Get all the examples working
- If the project gains traction I can move the repo to an organization so there can be more mantainers and contributions
- Add tests
- Add CI tools
- Add alternative use of [imagick](http://php.net/manual/en/imagick.setup.php)
